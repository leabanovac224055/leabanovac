                    <p class="large text-muted">Hi, I’m Lea Banovac, a student exploring the fascinating world of data science and AI. What I love most about these fields is how broad they are—you can dive into so many different areas and never run out of things to learn. Each new project teaches me something not just about AI, but about the world around us. From logistics to botany, I’ve had the chance to work with experts and tackle problems I never imagined, like intermodal transportation. My biggest passion is working on projects that can genuinely improve people’s lives, especially in health and sustainability. I’m always excited to keep learning and contribute to making the world a better place.</p>
