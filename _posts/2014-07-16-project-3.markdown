description: In this project, I developed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to classify emotions from speech data in the TV series *Expeditie Robinson*. The pipeline converted speech-to-text and tagged emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust, providing valuable insights to Banijay Benelux for content classification. The project involved data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation, as well as fine-tuning models on Banijay's labeled data to optimize emotion tagging accuracy.
