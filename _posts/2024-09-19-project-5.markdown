description: This project focused on understanding the impact, possibilities, and risks of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for students, staff, and the organization at BUas. Through a mixed-method study, including surveys and interviews, I explored AI attitudes, knowledge, acceptance, and perceived impact across various BUas domains. The findings were presented in a research paper, policy paper, and a conference poster, offering actionable insights for AI integration and strategy at BUas.
