description:  I developed a machine learning model to predict TV show ratings for Banijay Group's Dutch talk show Op1. The model utilized Twitter engagement metrics and show content data to forecast ratings. My contributions included data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and the development of a supervised learning regression model using Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and Power BI. Despite modest prediction accuracy, the model provided actionable insights into the connection between Twitter activity and TV ratings. Additionally, I incorporated a section on AI ethics, analyzing Banijayâ€™s corporate policies on transparency, diversity, and responsible data handling.
