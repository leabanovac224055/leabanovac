description: I developed an AI-powered food spoilage detection app prototype designed to help elderly people determine whether food, particularly bread, is spoiled or safe to eat. The app uses a CNN model for image classification and includes reminders to consume food before expiration. The project involved market research, dataset analysis, model development using Python and Keras, and designing a user-friendly prototype in Proto.io. User testing and feedback were incorporated to enhance usability and ensure continuous learning by allowing users to label the images and improve the model's performance over time.
