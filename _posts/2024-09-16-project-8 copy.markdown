description:  I contributed to the development of a smart parking app prototype aimed at reducing parking congestion in Breda. The app, built using Proto.io, features dynamic pricing, GPS navigation to parking spots, and real-time availability tracking. My contributions spanned exploratory data analysis using Python and SQL as well as designing and building the app prototype. The app prototype was built to optimize parking resources and improve the user experience for both tourists and residents.
